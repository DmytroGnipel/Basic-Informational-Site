<h2>History</h2>
<p>
  In July 1769, Russian military commanders built a redoubt there, and
  Zaporizhia Cossacks carried out their duty service there. On 2 February 1784,
  Catherine II issued the decree to create the Taurida Oblast on the lands that
  had been won. The deputy of Novorossiya Grigory Potemkin signed the relation
  to establish a town that very year – and Cossacks' families and those of
  retired soldiers of Suvorov settled on the right bank of the Molochna River.
  Among others, Germans were encouraged to settle in the new province, and some
  villages in this area were for many years German-speaking, such as Heidelberg
  (now Pryshyb) some 50 km (31 mi) to the north of Melitopol.
</p>
<p>
  In 1816, the settlement got the name sloboda of Novoalexandrovka. Its
  population was increasing due to the importation of peasants from the northern
  provinces of Ukraine and Russia. On 7 January 1842, the sloboda was recognized
  as a town and received the new name of Melitopol after a port city of Melita
  (from Greek Μέλι (meli) – "honey") which had been situated on the mouth of the
  Molochna River. At the end of the 19th century, the "Honey-city" had been
  developed as a trade center – there were some banks, credit organizations and
  wholesale stores. The largest enterprises in the city at the time were the
  iron foundry and the Brothers Klassen's machinery construction factory (1886),
  the railroad depot and the workshops.
</p>
<p>
  Further development of the city was closely connected with trade, iron and
  engineering industries, and railway service in the Crimean direction. In the
  early twentieth century there were fifteen thousand people living in
  Melitopol. 30 factories and 350 shops operated in the city at that time. In
  the second half of the twentieth century there was a strong economic growth of
  the city: new factories, plants, and housing estates were constructed. Sixteen
  Melitopol business enterprises received All-Soviet Union significance status.
  Industrial products were exported to more than 50 countries.
</p>
<h3>World War II</h3>
<p>
  In 1941, the Soviet Union was attacked by Germany. The city became
  strategically important due to its location. The Red Army was not ready for
  the war and had to retreat. The German Wehrmacht occupied Melitopol on 6
  October 1941. Within one week the entire remaining Jewish population of
  Melitopol (2,000 men, women and children) were murdered by Einsatzgruppen,
  which was actively supported by the Wehrmacht. The Germans operated a Nazi
  prison in the city.

<p><b>The Wotan Line Battle</b></p>
<p>
  After breaking through on the Mius River and defeating Axis troops in the
  Donbas and Taganrog, the Soviet Southern Front army pursuing the retreating
  enemy came to the Molochna River on 22 September 1943. Here, in the basin of
  the Milk River, German troops had begun to build a strong long-term defence
  which they called the Panther-Wotan line. It was on this line that the fate of
  the Crimean peninsula and the whole course of offensive operations in the
  southern Soviet Union were decided.
</p>
<p>
  The German defense consisted of four lines, covered with solid anti-tank
  ditches and land mines. The first attempt of the Soviet Southern Front army to
  break through was unsuccessful. Soviet commanders decided to prepare
  thoroughly a new attempt: the so-called “Melitopol operation”, which was
  carried out successfully from 26 September to 5 November 1943.
</p>
<p>
  Fighting lasted long, as the Germans introduced fresh reserves in order to
  keep Melitopol. Finally, after many days of heavy street fighting against
  vastly superior numbers of men and equipment, German resistance was broken and
  on 23 October the Red Army took complete control of the city. By decrees of
  the Presidium of the USSR Supreme Soviet, 87 Red soldiers and airmen were
  awarded the title of "Hero of the Soviet Union" for their actions in the
  reconquest of Melitopol.
